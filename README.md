# BlueBubbles Android App

For those of you that do not know; BlueBubbles is an open-source and cross-platform ecosystem of apps aimed to bring iMessage to all of your devices. That includes Android, Windows, Linux, etc. As such, this app allows you to bring iMessage to your Android device! With BlueBubbles, you'll be able to send messages, images, audio, GIFs, and much more to your friends and family.

We want to be more than just another iMessage app. We want to be community-driven and as open as possible to show that we encourage all forms of help to improve the ecosystem. All help is appreciated! Of course, we will add our _touch_ to it as much as possible to make your experience as flawless and as enjoyable as it possibly can. This means quality of life updates that even our Apple OS app-counterparts do not support. The only requirement is that you have access to a device running macOS High Sierra or later. We hope you enjoy using the app!
