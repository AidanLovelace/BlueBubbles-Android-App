# BlueBubbles

iMessage for android solution, open source and free. It uses a Mac server to send messages through iMessage.

You will need a mac to set this up

## Getting Started

All android builds can be found in [here](https://github.com/BlueBubblesApp/BlueBubbles-Android-App/releases)

All server builds can be found in [here](https://github.com/BlueBubblesApp/BlueBubbles-Server/releases)

After downloading both, follow our tutorial [here](https://bluebubbles.app/install/)

## Building from source

Because of a few limitations with flutter and gif insertion in the textfield, we have had to modify both the flutter framework and the engine. It is a pain to setup. At the moment, you will be unable to setup the app from source, however a tutorial is coming soon

## Contributing

We have very simple requirements to contribute.

- Write clean code
- Comment your code
- Follow [dart doc guidelines](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart)
